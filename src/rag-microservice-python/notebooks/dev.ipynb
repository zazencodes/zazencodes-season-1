After unfreezing it, the trio ends up in a decaying dimension. They split into separate timelines whenever they are uncertain about something. Rick becomes paranoid, thinking that his duplicates want to kill him, but eventually he calms down. A creature in charge of safeguarding time appears and gives them collars that integrate all the timelines, then attempts to arrest them because Rick stole the time-freezing crystal. Rick, Morty, and Summer show uncertainty on purpose and break the collars, splitting into sixty-four timelines, and they simultaneously beat up the same creature. Rick then repairs the collars, and they successfully integrate all the timelines. In one timeline, Rick attempts to sacrifice himself and let Morty live by giving him his collar, but ultimately he survives too. Meanwhile, Beth and Jerry hit a deer, and bring it to an animal hospital. A hunter claims the deer for his own because he shot it before the accident. Beth is able to save the deer\\'s life and release it.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: The creature and his friend beat up Albert Einstein, mistaking him for Rick. They have to tell him that he should not be messing with time, but this leads Einstein to spite them by devising the famous mass–energy equivalence equation, E=mc2.\\n\\nSeason 2, Episode 2: \"Mortynight Run\"\\tDominic Polcino\\tDavid Phillips\\tAugust 2, 2015\\tRAM-202\\t2.19[12]\\nRick takes Morty on a trip to teach him how to pilot the flying car. When Rick realizes that Jerry has followed them without being noticed in the back seat, he leaves him in a daycare specifically designed for Jerries from alternate realities. Jerry socializes with other Jerries, some of them left there indefinitely because their Rick and Morty never returned. Rick sells an antimatter gun to Krombopulos Michael, an alien assassin who intends to use it to eliminate a gaseous being whom Rick nicknames Fart that is held captive by alien authorities. Rick plans to spend the day at the \"Blips & Chitz\" video arcade, but Morty decides to stop the assassin. After Rick and Morty release Fart, they are chased by the authorities. Fart uses telepathic powers to kill the authorities, which also leads to civilian casualties. Later, Morty learns that Fart wants to eliminate all carbon-based life forms. Morty then kills Fart using Krombopulous Michael\\'s antimatter gun. Rick and Morty return to pick up their Jerry, but it is left unclear whether they got the right one.[a]\\n\\nPost-credits scene: A promotional ad for \"Blips & Chitz\" with Rick making an appearance.\\n\\nSeason 2, Episode 3: \"Auto Erotic Assimilation\"\\tBryan Newton\\tRyan Ridley\\tAugust 9, 2015\\tRAM-203\\t1.94[13]\\nRick attempts to loot a damaged spaceship with Morty and Summer. They find Unity, a hive mind and Rick\\'s ex-lover. It plans to eventually assimilate the whole universe. Beta 7 is a male hive mind who has a crush on Unity, which it rejects. In a planet completely assimilated by Unity, it and Rick have parties, have sex, and drink and use drugs together. In light of all the revelry, it loses control and the planet is left messy and untended. Summer finds the assimilation unethical, until she and Morty witness some inhabitants regain their identities and start a race war. Eventually, Unity decides to leave Rick for its own good. Meanwhile, Beth and Jerry find a secret underground room with a slug-like monster. The couple has an argument where Jerry makes accusations against Rick and Beth tries to defend her father. The monster breaks free of its chains and accuses Beth and Jerry of having the worst relationship it has ever seen. An upset Beth confronts a visibly distressed Rick, who attempts suicide in the garage but fails.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: A drunken Rick attempts to contact Unity only to be blocked by Beta 7.\\n\\nSeason 2, Episode 4: \"Total Rickall\"\\tJuan Meza-León\\tMike McMahan\\tAugust 16, 2015\\tRAM-204\\t1.96[14]\\nAlien parasites plant fake memories in the minds of the Smith family and pretend they are friends and family members. Every time the family reminisces about the past, the aliens reproduce. The family can\\'t distinguish real people from aliens, so eventually they can\\'t even trust each other. To prevent further spread, Rick locks down the house. At first, the only alien present is the fake \"Uncle Steve\"; they are soon joined by other aliens including Cousin Nicky, Sleepy Gary (who poses as Beth\\'s husband and Jerry\\'s lover), the family butler Mr. Beauregard, Frankenstein\\'s Monster, a talking pencil named Pencilvester, Tinkles the Fairy Lamb, etc. Mr. Poopybutthole is an unusual yellow creature who did not appear in any previous episode but appears to be a longtime friend. Eventually, Morty discovers that the parasites can only create positive memories, allowing the Smith family to confirm one another\\'s existence and kill all the aliens. As they sit down to dinner, Beth shoots Mr. Poopybutthole, thinking he is a parasite as well, but he turns out to be real.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Mr. Poopybutthole goes through physical therapy. Beth is devastated.\\n\\nNote: An alternate version of this episode, titled \"Rick and Morty Babies,\" premiered on Adult Swim as part of its 2021 April Fools\\' Day prank. This version featured all of the characters dubbed over to sound like children and changed some of the profanity to more \"kid-friendly\" alternatives.\\n\\nSeason 2, Episode 5: \"Get Schwifty\"\\tWes Archer\\tTom Kauffman\\tAugust 23, 2015\\tRAM-205\\t2.12[15]\\nA massive alien head (a \"Cromulon\") appears over Earth, demanding to hear an original song, so Rick and Morty improvise \"Get Schwifty\". The whole planet is abducted and forced to participate in a musical talent show, where the losers\\' planets are obliterated via plasma ray. Morty steals Rick\\'s portal gun and leaves him alone with Ice-T—the only musician to survive an earthquake that struck the Grammy Awards—to make a hit original song and save earth. Morty stumbles across Birdperson (living with Tammy since \"Ricksy Business\"), who persuades him to go back to Rick. Ice-T is revealed to be an ice alien who does not initially care about Earth, but he later changes his mind and saves the planet. Rick, Morty, and the US president win the competition by improvising \"Head Bent Over\". Meanwhile, Jerry, Beth, and Summer enter a religious cult based on an incorrect interpretation of the message from Cromulons. The movement quickly disbands after realizing it was all a musical talent show.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Back at Alphabetrium, Ice-T\\'s home planet, his father rewards Ice-T by lifting his exile and restoring his true form, \"Water-T\". The Numbericons attack and Water-T rushes out to battle. This is an action movie promo.\\n\\nSeason 2, Episode 6: \"The Ricks Must Be Crazy\"\\tDominic Polcino\\tDan Guterman\\tAugust 30, 2015\\tRAM-206\\t1.91[16]\\nRick\\'s flying car will not start, so he and Morty investigate the problem. The car\\'s battery contains a miniature universe and Rick has been threatening their destruction if they do not generate electricity. Inside it, Zeep Xanflorp, that universe\\'s top scientist, created a second miniature universe for the same purpose. Rick, Morty and Zeep are left stranded in a third miniature universe, as the pilot commits suicide and destroys his ship. Rick and Zeep constantly fight, and Morty abandons them and becomes a native chief. Morty forces the two scientists to work together to escape. While escaping, Rick reveals that Morty can turn into a car if needed. Ultimately, Rick and Morty leave the battery, trapping Zeep. Zeep is forced to discontinue his miniature universe research and have his people resume generating electricity to prevent Rick from destroying their universe. Meanwhile, Summer is forced to stay in the flying car, which uses violence to \"keep Summer safe\" from strangers, while she protests. However, it is effectively pardoned once it prepares a peace treaty, ending the human-spider war that has existed in this alternate reality. As a result, ice cream is now served with flies to appeal to spiders.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Morty suddenly turns into a car in his class.\\n\\nSeason 2, Episode 7: \"Big Trouble in Little Sanchez\"\\tBryan Newton\\tAlex Rubens\\tSeptember 13, 2015\\tRAM-207\\t1.97[17]\\nRick becomes \"Tiny Rick\" by transferring his mind to a teenage clone of himself in order to kill a vampire in Morty and Summer\\'s school. Tiny Rick is outgoing and popular, but subconsciously cries for help in song lyrics and drawings. Much to the disdain of her classmates, Summer deliberately gets him expelled by denouncing him as the killer of the vampire Coach Feratu (a reference to Nosferatu). Morty and Summer eventually persuade Rick to return to his body. Meanwhile, Jerry and Beth experience couple therapy on an alien planet. Two manifestations of the partners\\' perceptions of one another are created: Jerry\\'s Beth is embodied as a towering, hostile Xenomorph-like insectoid, and Beth\\'s Jerry is a servile worm. The insectoid Beth goes on a rampage with the help of the worm Jerry, killing several couples and employees. Eventually, Jerry acts in a brave way, causing Beth to envision a strong Jerry, which in turn envisions a goddess-like Beth, who destroys the insectoid monster.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: The lead vampire complains about the use of names like \"Coach Feratu\" that give away their vampire status.\\nSeason 2, Episode 8: \"Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate\"\\tJuan Meza-León\\tDan Guterman, Ryan Ridley & Justin Roiland\\tSeptember 20, 2015\\tRAM-208\\t1.79[18]\\nJerry is treated in an alien hospital after unknowingly ingesting some bacteria stored by Rick in a pint of Cherry Garcia. While his family is in the waiting room, watching an assortment of TV channels from alternate realities, Jerry is asked by doctors to donate his penis, to be converted into a replacement heart to save the life of civil rights activist Shrimply Pibbles. Jerry complies, but publicly tries to talk his way out of it nonetheless. This causes Jerry to be hated by the public, but also raises awareness as well as money to buy a synthetic heart for Pibbles. Eventually, Jerry changes his mind and holds the doctors hostage, demanding that they go through with the transplant procedure, but Security stops him. The family is then sent home, with Beth chastising Jerry that he should not care so much about what strangers think of him.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Jerry tries to eat Rick\\'s \"Eyeholes\", an alien cereal that appeared in the interdimensional TV, only for the Eyehole Man to burst through the window and begin relentlessly beating him.\\n\\nSeason 2, Episode 9: \"Look Who\\'s Purging Now\"\\tDominic Polcino\\tDan Harmon, Ryan Ridley & Justin Roiland\\tSeptember 27, 2015\\tRAM-210\\t1.89[19]\\nRick and Morty visit another planet to purchase wiper fluid and witness \"The Festival\", an annual event where the local populace commits crimes for one night without consequence. After initial hesitation, Morty forces Rick to rescue Arthricia, a young alien girl, who proceeds to betray them, stealing Rick\\'s gun and spaceship. Rick calls Summer, who transports them advanced armor suits. Morty then goes on a seemingly uncharacteristic killing spree before Rick knocks him out, and he and Arthricia—who desired to stop the Festival—storm the castle of the corrupt nobility who introduced it, slaughtering them. The planet\\'s remaining inhabitants decide to create a new society; however, rioting breaks out over disputes, and one suggests keeping the Festival after all.

Meanwhile, Jerry encounters a talking cat in his bedroom, but Rick insists he has nothing to do with it. The cat convinces Jerry to take it to Florida to find fun at beach party, but the cat betrays Jerry by accusing him of defecating on the beach. However, the cat only ends up annoying everybody at the party, resulting in it getting kicked out along with Jerry. Morty tries to play with Balthromaw, but it is clear Balthromaw doesn\\'t like Morty, which frustrates him. Angered at Balthromaw stealing Morty\\'s attention, Rick tries to kill the dragon, but they both end up realizing they have much in common and inadvertently soul bond. The Wizard then arrives, accuses Balthromaw of being a \"slut dragon\", and takes him away to be executed. Rick helps Morty rescue Balthromaw, since the soul bond means he will die if Balthromaw does. With the help of other slut dragons, Rick and Morty are able to rescue Balthromaw, kill the Wizard, and break the soul bond. Now uncomfortable with how sexual dragons are, Rick and Morty part ways with Balthromaw. Rick and Jerry scan the cat\\'s mind to figure out why it can talk, and are horrified at what they see.

However, Jerry later loses one of his shoes which causes him to float away and get lost. While traveling through space, Rick\\'s spaceship gets a \"flat tire\", which requires Rick to stop to repair it. Morty disobeys Rick\\'s order to stay in the spaceship, and is bitten by a space snake. As Rick analyzes the snake for an antidote, he and Morty learn that it is in fact an astronaut from a planet of intelligent snakes that are on the brink of a world war. Feeling guilty, Morty secretly replaces the dead snake astronaut with a regular snake and drops it off at the snake planet. The alien snakes soon realize Morty\\'s snake is not native to their planet. Later, time-traveling robot snakes arrive at Morty\\'s house to try to protect and kill him. With help from a future version of himself, Rick travels back in time and leaves the secrets of time travel to the snakes earlier in their timeline, which eventually results in them abusing time travel enough to attract the attention of the Time Police, who destroy their civilization by eliminating their first intelligent ancestor.

After killing the train\\'s ticket taker, using a \"continuity explosion\" to find a map of the train, and fabricating a story that passes the Bechdel test, the two reach the train\\'s engine room. There they confront Story Lord, who beats and captures them with the intent of using their \"story potential\" to power the train enough to take it beyond the fifth wall. They experience various possible futures, culminating in Rick and Morty facing an army commanded by President Morty. Rick averts the battle by having himself and Morty give their lives to Jesus. The anticlimax slows Story Train to a halt, causing Story Lord to angrily enter the potential future as Jesus himself appears. Rick and Morty use the literal deus ex machina to escape back onto Story Train and strand Story Lord in \"every writer\\'s hell: the Bible.\" When they try to return home, however, Rick discovers the train control panel is fake, and it\\'s revealed that Story Train is a model train operating inside the Smith household. After Story Lord explains the nature of their reality and an origin story of Yahweh to Jesus, he breaks the toy. Rick, in a semi-lucid drunken stupor, chastises Morty to buy another one, as \"Nobody\\'s out there shopping with this fucking virus\".\\n\\nPost-credits scene: A toy commercial for \"The Citadel of Ricks Story Train\".\\n\\nSeason 4, Episode 7: \"Promortyus\"\\tBryan Newton\\tJeff Loveness\\tMay 10, 2020\\tRAM-406\\t1.34[14]\\nRick and Morty find out that they have been mind controlled by facehugging parasites called the Glorzo, and that they are attempting to use Rick\\'s UFO to power a superweapon that will spread the Glorzo to Earth. Rick and Morty manage to fight their way off the planet, causing mass destruction. However, upon returning home, they realize they left Summer behind and return on a rescue mission, only to find that Summer does not have a Glorzo attached to her and is worshiped as a goddess. Summer explains that after Rick and Morty fell under the control of the Glorzo, she was spared due to a toothpick in her mouth, which prevented the Glorzo from being able to latch on to her face and caused them to consider her a goddess. The three of them attempt to escape, but are blocked by the rest of the Glorzo. Rick then uses a tune from Morty\\'s harmonica, which triggers the Glorzo\\'s host body to lay its implanted egg, resulting in the death of both the host and the controlling Glorzo. All of the Glorzos are killed, but not before accusing Rick, Morty, and Summer of destroying them simply for trying to advance their civilization. Upon returning home, Rick and Morty start feeling severe stomach pain. Fearing they\\'re about to lay Glorzo eggs, the two say their final goodbyes to each other, but it turns out the pain was from a regular bowel movement.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Summer\\'s friend Tricia Lange takes an interest in Jerry due to his beekeeping hobby, and expresses her interest in having sex with him, much to Summer\\'s annoyance.\\n\\nSeason 4, Episode 8: \"The Vat of Acid Episode\"\\tJacob Hair\\tJeff Loveness & Albro Lundy\\tMay 17, 2020\\tRAM-408\\t1.26[15]\\nWhile on a mission, Rick and Morty trade special gems with alien gangsters. The gangsters betray them and Rick fakes his and Morty\\'s deaths by jumping into a vat of fake acid. However, as they hide in the vat, the gangsters don\\'t immediately leave. Morty grows impatient and kills the gangsters with Rick\\'s gun, accusing Rick of having a bad idea with the vat of acid. Morty then dares Rick to invent something based on one of his ideas, where he can create a \"save point\" in time that he can return to in order to escape death or correct mistakes. Rick grudgingly agrees creating a special remote, but Morty takes it before he can explain how it works. Morty then commits numerous crimes and pranks and resets himself to avoid consequences. Eventually, though, Morty falls in love and starts a relationship with a young woman. When they end up stranded in the wilderness, Morty considers using the remote but calls for rescue instead, wanting to preserve the relationship he has. However, after Morty is rescued, Jerry accidentally presses the remote, resetting Morty back to before the relationship started. Morty fails his attempt to restart the relationship when his save point is accidentally overwritten, and he returns to Rick, saying he has learned his lesson that one shouldn\\'t live a consequence free life. Rick then reveals that the remote does not reset the timeline, but instead teleports Morty to an alternate dimension, and also kills the Morty native to that dimension so Morty can take his place. Horrified, Morty begs Rick to undo everything, so Rick merges all of the alternate dimensions. While this prevents the deaths of the alternate Mortys, everybody remembers the crimes Morty committed, and the only way he can escape is to jump into a vat of fake acid to fake his death. Satisfied his point was proven, Rick reveals they were in an alternate dimension this entire time, as he didn\\'t want to risk Morty ruining their home dimension.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: A policeman who believes he\\'s impervious to acid appears on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (Johnny Carson still being alive in the alternate dimension) and lowers himself into a vat of real acid, which results in his death.\\n\\nSeason 4, Episode 9: \"Childrick of Mort\"\\tKyounghee Lim\\tJames Siciliano\\tMay 24, 2020\\tRAM-409\\t1.22[16]\\nAs Jerry takes the family out on a camping trip, Rick receives a call from Gaia, a sentient planet, that she is pregnant with his children.

Jerry takes Morty and Summer into the wilderness to camp while Rick and Beth build an advanced civilization for the Gaians so they can be self sufficient. However, as part of their process to sort the Gaians into professions, a number of them are classified as \"unproductive\" and banished from the city. Meanwhile, Morty and Summer abandon Jerry, angry at him for forcing them on the camping trip. Jerry comes across the Unproductives and raises them as a primitive, tribal society. Morty and Summer find a crashed alien spaceship and manage to make it fly after some improvised repair. Suddenly, Reggie, a godlike being who is the true father of the Gaians, arrives to take custody of them. Rick, realizing that Reggie has no interest in actually taking care of the Gaians, refuses to give up custody. Jerry then arrives with the Unproductives to attack the Gaians, so Reggie empowers Jerry while Rick gives Beth an advanced gun. Rick then fights Reggie hand to hand but is nearly defeated; then Morty and Summer\\'s spaceship crashes into Reggie\\'s head, killing him. Reggie\\'s body falls on Gaia, destroying the city and killing many Gaians while Jerry rescues Beth. Furious at Reggie\\'s death, Gaia chases Rick and his family back into space.

Rick accidentally lets slip that Space Beth might in fact be the clone, and races to Dr. Wong\\'s office to save Beth from Tammy and a squad of soldiers, who have mistaken her for Space Beth. Rick, Beth, and Jerry rendezvous with Space Beth, and both Beths are now mad at Rick for his refusal to disclose which is the clone. They are again attacked by Tammy, who takes the Beths prisoner and beams them up to the Federation\\'s ship. Morty and Summer intervene and Rick kills Tammy. The family heads to the ship, with Rick going to free the Beths while Morty and Summer shut off its superlaser before it can annihilate Earth. The Beths escape on their own as Rick is confronted by Phoenixperson, who almost kills him before being shut down by Space Beth (with Jerry\\'s help). In the aftermath, Rick retrieves the memory tube containing his memory of creating the clone Beth, having erased his own knowledge of which Beth is the original. However, no one in the family is interested in learning the truth. Rick watches the memory nonetheless, only to learn that Beth asked him to decide for himself whether he wanted her in his life.

Feeling guilty, Morty reveals the truth at a funeral. After this, the planet\\'s President legalizes suicide, and spaghetti becomes the planet\\'s primary export, with most people channeled into suicide to be sold as spaghetti to meet the demand. Rick\\'s attempts to fix things by sourcing the spaghetti from clones end disastrously, so he has one last terminally ill person commit suicide on a live broadcast and offers his spaghetti to Morty. During the broadcast, he shows everyone the man\\'s entire life causing everyone to vomit at the horrors they are committing, turning everyone off spaghetti. Later, Rick serves the family Salisbury steak, warning that its source is also horrifying. The family laughs this off, content to remain ignorant of its origin.\\n\\nPost-credits scene\\u200a: On a planet of sentient vacuum cleaners, a similar planet-wide broadcast reveals that vacuum bags come from deceased plant creatures, causing all the vacuums to vomit dust.\\n\\nSeason 7, Episode 5: \"Unmortricken\"\\tJacob Hair\\tAlbro Lundy & James Siciliano\\tNovember 12, 2023\\tRAM-705\\t0.46[9]\\nThe episode opens by showing Evil Morty\\'s backstory: having grown tired of demeaning adventures with his Rick, Evil Morty implanted devices to control him, leading into his actions throughout the series.[a] His peaceful retirement outside the Central Finite Curve is interrupted by Rick and Morty\\'s search for Rick Prime. Evil Morty confronts Rick and Morty, and all three are captured by Rick Prime, along with other Ricks whose wives were killed by him. After surviving a gladiator match with the other Ricks, they find Rick Prime and learn he built the \"Omega Device\", a machine which can erase anyone from every universe, which he used to erase Rick\\'s wife Diane, and demonstrates by summoning and erasing Slow Mobius (Rick\\'s \"uncle\"). Evil Morty incapacitates Rick Prime, and steals and deactivates the Omega Device before allowing Rick to beat Rick Prime to death. Evil Morty leaves with the Omega device, using it as warning for Rick and Morty to not come after him, as he simply wants to be left alone. Rick and Morty then travel home, with Rick returning to his daily routine while being visibly fazed by the preceding events, unsatisfied with the revenge against his nemesis that he had wanted for so long.\\n\\nPost-credits scene\\u200a: Slow Mobius\\' wife goes searching for him throughout the multiverse to no avail, the same way Rick searched for Rick Prime. She eventually meets an alien who similarly lost his wife, and they marry.

Suspecting that Morty may have lied about the number of adventures they have gone on, Rick enlists the aid of an omniscient alien rock called the Observer to audit the Adventure Cards. As the Observer shows them various past adventures, Rick and Morty eventually get fed up with him treating their lives like a clip show and tell him to leave. However, the Observer returns and begins harassing the entire Smith family by showing clips of their most embarrassing moments. Morty loses his temper and strikes the Observer, inadvertently killing him and inciting the anger of the other Observers to put them on trial on whether they are good or evil. The Observers then make legal arguments based on Rick and Morty\\'s past exploits before sentencing them to death. In response, Rick hacks their observation technology and shows that the Observers regularly abuse their powers for selfish gains, causing the Observers to attack each other. Rick and Morty escape in the confusion, and Rick decides to take Morty on a new adventure.\\n\\nPost-credits scene\\u200a: Morty opens his locker and is shocked to find a warning left behind by Churry, a sentient churro he had Rick bring to life, befriended, and subsequently abandoned on an uninhabited planet, with Churry swearing to take revenge on him.\\n\\nSeason 7, Episode 7: \"Wet Kuat Amortican Summer\"\\tKyounghee Lim\\tAlex Song-Xia\\tNovember 26, 2023\\tRAM-708\\t0.49[11]\\nSummer obtains an \"attribute slider\" from Rick that allows her to change her physical attributes which she plans to use to impress her friends at a party. However, Morty gets jealous and tries to steal the attribute slider, causing them to both fall into the pool. The water short circuits the attribute slider which fuses Summer and Morty\\'s bodies together and Morty becomes a \"Kuato\". Summer is ridiculed by her friends and Rick refuses to reverse the effects unless she does chores for him. Summer attends a nightclub exclusively for Kuato holders like her, organized by a man named Kenneth, who is running a Kuato trafficking ring and steals Morty.

Goldenfold manages to decipher the equation to discover the location of the mythical planet E-10 where Water-T and Sinistar-7 reluctantly team up to unlock the I of Harmony\\'s secrets. However, Numbericon spy Number Eight steals the power of the I of Harmony for himself, becoming Infinity. Going mad with power, Infinity begins massacring both Alphabetrians and Numbericons.

When Rick and Morty return Bigfoot cuts a deal with them to stop the Pope. The Pope, having gained the energy from the Afterlife, kills them, but they revive using Operation Phoenix, making Bigfoot a human in the process. After failing to stop the Pope with the help of the Universal Monsters, Rick tricks the Vikings into pulling the plug on the energy after they escape, stripping the Pope of his powers.

They are then approached by a man in a suit who offers them a truly terrifying experience, bringing them to a \"Fear Hole\" located in a Denny\\'s bathroom. Morty decides to leap in to face his fears, only for Rick to jump in after him to rescue him from monsters. Upon returning home, Rick and Morty realize that they\\'re still in the Fear Hole. However, no matter how many times they seemingly leave the Fear Hole, they never truly escape it. After their latest failed escape attempt, Rick offhandedly mentions that Morty is irreplaceable, which causes Morty to realize he\\'s not talking to the real Rick, and that Rick never followed him into the Fear Hole to begin with. Morty comes to the realization that his true fear is Rick leaving him. Upon overcoming his true fear, Morty finally escapes the Fear Hole. Rick is tempted to jump in himself after hearing that the Fear Hole can manifest Diane, but ultimately decides against it and leaves behind a picture of Morty from inside his wallet to commemorate his conquering of the Fear Hole.\\n\\nPost-credits scene\\u200a: P.B. uses a stolen portal gun to switch places with another P.B. in a universe where he is still married to Amy.

The original Jerry tells Morty that his Beth and Summer did not survive being frozen in \"The Rickshank Rickdemption\".[a] Jerry abandons Morty in order to move on. Rick rescues Morty and takes him to confront Rick Prime but finds an elaborate trap. Morty convinces him to save the rest of the family instead.

As a result, Morty becomes trapped in the virtual reality game Roy, with his identity split among the game\\'s five billion NPCs. Rick enters the game, playing as the titular Roy, to try to convince the NPCs that they are part of Morty. Rick builds millions of spaceships, planning on taking all the fragments to the edge of the map, which will reset the game and allow Rick and Morty to exit. However, Rick faces resistance from many Morty fragments, some of whom go to war with each other. One individualistic fragment, Marta, negotiates with Rick—she will convince the other Morty fragments to leave on one unspoken condition. Meanwhile, Summer picks off the terrorists, led by Chans, one by one. Chans explains that all sapient species develop the Die Hard mythology and that he is an expert who has written several books about it.

She and Beth bond over a bottle of Venusian Wine which Space Beth had brought back from Venus. Eventually, their casual flirting develops into a full-on love affair. Summer and Morty notice, but try to ignore it by playing \"realistic\" alien video games. Rick deduces the affair after he and his grandkids catch them pulling a \"San Junipero\" in his holodeck. Rick tells Beth that while he once did something similar, she must be careful about what this could do to the family. Summer and Morty become concerned about Jerry, who previously claimed he would kill himself if Beth cheated on him. When Space Beth admits to the affair to Jerry, he rolls up into a pillbug (an emotional defense system Rick built for him while they were drunk together). Both Beths ask Rick to erase their memories of the affair. Jerry overhears this and exits his pill bug form to stop the erasure, but says he is leaving Beth. Space Beth realizes that Jerry is only upset that the affair happened without his knowledge. With Jerry\\'s full consent, he and the Beths have a threesome, to Summer\\'s and Morty\\'s disgust. After Space Beth leaves, Rick locks the Venusian Wine in an invisible cabinet and destroys its key-remote.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Out of curiosity, Jerry visits the Jerryboree alone to seek an affair with another Jerry, but is stopped by the receptionist who says that they have had issues with that very thing.

The rest of the family create their own \"night people\" who exercise, learn new skills, and do household chores. Eventually, Night Summer leaves a note requesting that Rick rinse the dishes before she washes them, but Rick deliberately ignores the request. The escalating conflict between the Smiths and their \"night family\" over the dishes ends with Night Summer and her minions locking Rick out of his own technology, building a giant version of the somnambulator to maintain permanent control of their bodies, and enslaving their diurnal selves while the Night Family sleeps. The Smiths attempt to escape with the help of Night Jerry, whom Jerry had befriended by leaving handwritten notes for him, and a chaotic battle ensues as both sides fight for control by tranquilizing and waking each other. Night Summer offers a truce in exchange for Rick washing his dishes. Rick refuses and as a result, Summer allows his Night Person to retake control of his body.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: After months of living exorbitantly, the Night Family is left destitute. Rather than face the consequences, Night Rick simply destroys the somnambulator, returning Rick and the family to normal. However, they freak out when they learn the Choco Taco has been discontinued.\\n\\nSeason 6, Episode 5: \"Final DeSmithation\"\\tDouglas Einar Olsen\\tHeather Anne Campbell\\tOctober 2, 2022\\tRAM-607\\t0.58[9]\\n\\nJerry receives a fortune cookie that says he is destined to have sex with his mother. Upon noticing how circumstances seem to be moving inexorably toward said fortune, he and Rick infiltrate the fortune cookie factory to investigate while Morty, Summer, and both Beths visit the zoo. There, the two find that fortune cookies come from the excrement of a captive fate-altering alien called a Lockerean, and Jerry\\'s fortune came from its imprisoned caretaker in an attempt to draw scrutiny. CEO Jennith Padrow-Chunt brings in a squad of armed fortune-boosted guards, alongside Jerry\\'s mother to ensure he follows through with his fate, until Rick feeds Jerry another fortune cookie that cancels it out at the last minute. Because people are immortal until their fortunes are fulfilled, Rick finds a way to make Padrow-Chunt the world\\'s most successful businesswoman (her fate), thus rendering her vulnerable, and she and the caretaker are subsequently eaten by the Lockerean. After they return home, it is revealed that Rick survived by eating a fortune that said \"You\\'ll make a new friend\", which Jerry accidentally fulfills by thanking him and calling him a friend, much to Rick\\'s chagrin.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Morty, Summer and the Beths visit the zoo.

Rick and Morty visit other planets that the dinosaurs have tended, finding that they all suffered asteroid impacts similar to the one that caused the Chicxulub crater. Rick announces that dinosaurs have a rival species of homicidal sentient asteroids, one of which is headed for Earth. Reluctant to use violence even in self-defense, the dinosaurs leave to draw the impactor away. Rick hosts the Oscars, but leaves when Summer tells him the dinosaurs are on Mars awaiting their demise. He travels to Mars and tells the dinosaurs that selflessness and selfishness are the same, prompting them to destroy the asteroid. In thanks for Rick \"saving\" them, the dinosaurs fix the temporal rift, much to his dismay.

They are rescued by Joseph Campbell, who assists them in creating a device to return to the real world to confront Story Lord. Jan and Story Lord have created a machine capable of siphoning motivation from the universe\\'s inhabitants to fuel Story Lord\\'s own \"motivation.\" Morty, with the assistance of a spectral Campbell, convinces Jan to stop operating the machine, depowering Story Lord and allowing Rick to defeat him.

She recommends that he ignore them. A villain named Pissmaster goads Rick into battling him, which Jerry does in his place when Pissmaster makes a sexual remark about Summer. The incident goes viral and Jerry is invited to sit on a council of intergalactic superheroes, much to Rick\\'s jealousy, until Dr. Wong points out that Rick is now free of burden. Rick is happy at first until he discovers Pissmaster committing suicide, having left a note blaming Jerry. Rick dons Pissmaster\\'s suit and performs many heroic deeds, redeeming the villain\\'s public image. The council sends Jerry to offer Pissmaster a seat among them, which Jerry reluctantly and forcefully attempts to do as Rick disarms a bomb by sacrificing Pissmaster\\'s suit to cover his suicide with a heroic death. The council dismisses Jerry for his arrogance. Rick lies that he was Pissmaster all along to make Jerry feel better about himself, but secretly gives Morty the real Pissmaster\\'s suicide note. Horrified, Morty promptly tells the rest of the family, who berate Rick for his actions and shame Jerry for Pissmaster\\'s death.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: The council discusses whether to induct Mr. Nimbus from \"Mort Dinner Rick Andre\".\\n\\nSeason 6, Episode 9: \"A Rick in King Mortur\\'s Mort\"\\tJacob Hair\\tAnne Lane\\tDecember 4, 2022\\tRAM-609\\t0.53[13]\\nWhile waiting in line for food, a Knight of the Sun offers Morty his knighthood. Ignoring Rick\\'s warnings and calling him \"boring\", Morty goes to the Sun and is told that he must sever his penis to join the Knights. Morty refuses and attempts to leave; opposed by the King of the Sun, he bests the King in combat and becomes King himself. He exposes the Knights\\' worldview as flawed and convinces them to disband. Without the Knights\\' influence, a peace summit among the leaders of the planets fails and a war breaks out. Morty finds the Knights of the Sun using heroin and inspires them to resume their duties by promising he will cut off his penis, Rick having built him a fake. The war ends and all the planets accept Morty as King but have set up various machines to expose his fake penis, forcing Rick and Morty to fake their deaths. With this, the Knights end their tradition of emasculation.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: The hot dog vendor Rick bought food from at the start of the episode is arrested for illegal hot dog trafficking and the hot dogs are released into the wild.

This causes it to tunnel into the Earth, threatening to destroy the planet if it reaches the Earth\\'s core. Morty learns that Rick replaced himself with a robot after Morty had called him \"boring\" in \"A Rick in King Mortur\\'s Mort\", while the real Rick is busy with his search for Rick Prime. During their quest, Morty is aided by the President who then steals the lightsaber. The President accidentally drops the lightsaber in the same manner, forcing Morty and Rickbot to retrieve it. In the ensuing confrontation with the President at the White House (which the President launched into outer space to escape the possible destruction), Rickbot is mortally injured and the three are sucked into space, but Rick rescues them with a portal. Rickbot succumbs to his injuries and tells him he was only doing what Rick would have done in his place.

       "'\\nGiven the following information, answer the question.\\n\\nContext:\\n\\n    Season 2, Episode 1: \"A Rickle in Time\"\\tWes Archer\\tMatt Roller\\tJuly 26, 2015\\tRAM-201\\t2.12[11]\\nContinuing from \"Ricksy Business\", Rick, Morty and Summer spend six months repairing the house and screwing around with time frozen. After unfreezing it, the trio ends up in a decaying dimension. They split into separate timelines whenever they are uncertain about something. Rick becomes paranoid, thinking that his duplicates want to kill him, but eventually he calms down. A creature in charge of safeguarding time appears and gives them collars that integrate all the timelines, then attempts to arrest them because Rick stole the time-freezing crystal. Rick, Morty, and Summer show uncertainty on purpose and break the collars, splitting into sixty-four timelines, and they simultaneously beat up the same creature. Rick then repairs the collars, and they successfully integrate all the timelines. In one timeline, Rick attempts to sacrifice himself and let Morty live by giving him his collar, but ultimately he survives too. Meanwhile, Beth and Jerry hit a deer, and bring it to an animal hospital. A hunter claims the deer for his own because he shot it before the accident. Beth is able to save the deer\\'s life and release it.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: The creature and his friend beat up Albert Einstein, mistaking him for Rick. They have to tell him that he should not be messing with time, but this leads Einstein to spite them by devising the famous mass–energy equivalence equation, E=mc2.\\n\\nSeason 2, Episode 2: \"Mortynight Run\"\\tDominic Polcino\\tDavid Phillips\\tAugust 2, 2015\\tRAM-202\\t2.19[12]\\nRick takes Morty on a trip to teach him how to pilot the flying car. When Rick realizes that Jerry has followed them without being noticed in the back seat, he leaves him in a daycare specifically designed for Jerries from alternate realities. Jerry socializes with other Jerries, some of them left there indefinitely because their Rick and Morty never returned. Rick sells an antimatter gun to Krombopulos Michael, an alien assassin who intends to use it to eliminate a gaseous being whom Rick nicknames Fart that is held captive by alien authorities. Rick plans to spend the day at the \"Blips & Chitz\" video arcade, but Morty decides to stop the assassin. After Rick and Morty release Fart, they are chased by the authorities. Fart uses telepathic powers to kill the authorities, which also leads to civilian casualties. Later, Morty learns that Fart wants to eliminate all carbon-based life forms. Morty then kills Fart using Krombopulous Michael\\'s antimatter gun. Rick and Morty return to pick up their Jerry, but it is left unclear whether they got the right one.[a]\\n\\nPost-credits scene: A promotional ad for \"Blips & Chitz\" with Rick making an appearance.\\n\\nSeason 2, Episode 3: \"Auto Erotic Assimilation\"\\tBryan Newton\\tRyan Ridley\\tAugust 9, 2015\\tRAM-203\\t1.94[13]\\nRick attempts to loot a damaged spaceship with Morty and Summer. They find Unity, a hive mind and Rick\\'s ex-lover. It plans to eventually assimilate the whole universe. Beta 7 is a male hive mind who has a crush on Unity, which it rejects. In a planet completely assimilated by Unity, it and Rick have parties, have sex, and drink and use drugs together. In light of all the revelry, it loses control and the planet is left messy and untended. Summer finds the assimilation unethical, until she and Morty witness some inhabitants regain their identities and start a race war. Eventually, Unity decides to leave Rick for its own good. Meanwhile, Beth and Jerry find a secret underground room with a slug-like monster. The couple has an argument where Jerry makes accusations against Rick and Beth tries to defend her father. The monster breaks free of its chains and accuses Beth and Jerry of having the worst relationship it has ever seen. An upset Beth confronts a visibly distressed Rick, who attempts suicide in the garage but fails.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: A drunken Rick attempts to contact Unity only to be blocked by Beta 7.\\n\\nSeason 2, Episode 4: \"Total Rickall\"\\tJuan Meza-León\\tMike McMahan\\tAugust 16, 2015\\tRAM-204\\t1.96[14]\\nAlien parasites plant fake memories in the minds of the Smith family and pretend they are friends and family members. Every time the family reminisces about the past, the aliens reproduce. The family can\\'t distinguish real people from aliens, so eventually they can\\'t even trust each other. To prevent further spread, Rick locks down the house. At first, the only alien present is the fake \"Uncle Steve\"; they are soon joined by other aliens including Cousin Nicky, Sleepy Gary (who poses as Beth\\'s husband and Jerry\\'s lover), the family butler Mr. Beauregard, Frankenstein\\'s Monster, a talking pencil named Pencilvester, Tinkles the Fairy Lamb, etc. Mr. Poopybutthole is an unusual yellow creature who did not appear in any previous episode but appears to be a longtime friend. Eventually, Morty discovers that the parasites can only create positive memories, allowing the Smith family to confirm one another\\'s existence and kill all the aliens. As they sit down to dinner, Beth shoots Mr. Poopybutthole, thinking he is a parasite as well, but he turns out to be real.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Mr. Poopybutthole goes through physical therapy. Beth is devastated.\\n\\nNote: An alternate version of this episode, titled \"Rick and Morty Babies,\" premiered on Adult Swim as part of its 2021 April Fools\\' Day prank. This version featured all of the characters dubbed over to sound like children and changed some of the profanity to more \"kid-friendly\" alternatives.\\n\\nSeason 2, Episode 5: \"Get Schwifty\"\\tWes Archer\\tTom Kauffman\\tAugust 23, 2015\\tRAM-205\\t2.12[15]\\nA massive alien head (a \"Cromulon\") appears over Earth, demanding to hear an original song, so Rick and Morty improvise \"Get Schwifty\". The whole planet is abducted and forced to participate in a musical talent show, where the losers\\' planets are obliterated via plasma ray. Morty steals Rick\\'s portal gun and leaves him alone with Ice-T—the only musician to survive an earthquake that struck the Grammy Awards—to make a hit original song and save earth. Morty stumbles across Birdperson (living with Tammy since \"Ricksy Business\"), who persuades him to go back to Rick. Ice-T is revealed to be an ice alien who does not initially care about Earth, but he later changes his mind and saves the planet. Rick, Morty, and the US president win the competition by improvising \"Head Bent Over\". Meanwhile, Jerry, Beth, and Summer enter a religious cult based on an incorrect interpretation of the message from Cromulons. The movement quickly disbands after realizing it was all a musical talent show.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Back at Alphabetrium, Ice-T\\'s home planet, his father rewards Ice-T by lifting his exile and restoring his true form, \"Water-T\". The Numbericons attack and Water-T rushes out to battle. This is an action movie promo.\\n\\nSeason 2, Episode 6: \"The Ricks Must Be Crazy\"\\tDominic Polcino\\tDan Guterman\\tAugust 30, 2015\\tRAM-206\\t1.91[16]\\nRick\\'s flying car will not start, so he and Morty investigate the problem. The car\\'s battery contains a miniature universe and Rick has been threatening their destruction if they do not generate electricity. Inside it, Zeep Xanflorp, that universe\\'s top scientist, created a second miniature universe for the same purpose. Rick, Morty and Zeep are left stranded in a third miniature universe, as the pilot commits suicide and destroys his ship. Rick and Zeep constantly fight, and Morty abandons them and becomes a native chief. Morty forces the two scientists to work together to escape. While escaping, Rick reveals that Morty can turn into a car if needed. Ultimately, Rick and Morty leave the battery, trapping Zeep. Zeep is forced to discontinue his miniature universe research and have his people resume generating electricity to prevent Rick from destroying their universe. Meanwhile, Summer is forced to stay in the flying car, which uses violence to \"keep Summer safe\" from strangers, while she protests. However, it is effectively pardoned once it prepares a peace treaty, ending the human-spider war that has existed in this alternate reality. As a result, ice cream is now served with flies to appeal to spiders.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Morty suddenly turns into a car in his class.\\n\\nSeason 2, Episode 7: \"Big Trouble in Little Sanchez\"\\tBryan Newton\\tAlex Rubens\\tSeptember 13, 2015\\tRAM-207\\t1.97[17]\\nRick becomes \"Tiny Rick\" by transferring his mind to a teenage clone of himself in order to kill a vampire in Morty and Summer\\'s school. Tiny Rick is outgoing and popular, but subconsciously cries for help in song lyrics and drawings. Much to the disdain of her classmates, Summer deliberately gets him expelled by denouncing him as the killer of the vampire Coach Feratu (a reference to Nosferatu). Morty and Summer eventually persuade Rick to return to his body. Meanwhile, Jerry and Beth experience couple therapy on an alien planet. Two manifestations of the partners\\' perceptions of one another are created: Jerry\\'s Beth is embodied as a towering, hostile Xenomorph-like insectoid, and Beth\\'s Jerry is a servile worm. The insectoid Beth goes on a rampage with the help of the worm Jerry, killing several couples and employees. Eventually, Jerry acts in a brave way, causing Beth to envision a strong Jerry, which in turn envisions a goddess-like Beth, who destroys the insectoid monster.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: The lead vampire complains about the use of names like \"Coach Feratu\" that give away their vampire status.\\nSeason 2, Episode 8: \"Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate\"\\tJuan Meza-León\\tDan Guterman, Ryan Ridley & Justin Roiland\\tSeptember 20, 2015\\tRAM-208\\t1.79[18]\\nJerry is treated in an alien hospital after unknowingly ingesting some bacteria stored by Rick in a pint of Cherry Garcia. While his family is in the waiting room, watching an assortment of TV channels from alternate realities, Jerry is asked by doctors to donate his penis, to be converted into a replacement heart to save the life of civil rights activist Shrimply Pibbles. Jerry complies, but publicly tries to talk his way out of it nonetheless. This causes Jerry to be hated by the public, but also raises awareness as well as money to buy a synthetic heart for Pibbles. Eventually, Jerry changes his mind and holds the doctors hostage, demanding that they go through with the transplant procedure, but Security stops him. The family is then sent home, with Beth chastising Jerry that he should not care so much about what strangers think of him.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Jerry tries to eat Rick\\'s \"Eyeholes\", an alien cereal that appeared in the interdimensional TV, only for the Eyehole Man to burst through the window and begin relentlessly beating him.\\n\\nSeason 2, Episode 9: \"Look Who\\'s Purging Now\"\\tDominic Polcino\\tDan Harmon, Ryan Ridley & Justin Roiland\\tSeptember 27, 2015\\tRAM-210\\t1.89[19]\\nRick and Morty visit another planet to purchase wiper fluid and witness \"The Festival\", an annual event where the local populace commits crimes for one night without consequence. After initial hesitation, Morty forces Rick to rescue Arthricia, a young alien girl, who proceeds to betray them, stealing Rick\\'s gun and spaceship. Rick calls Summer, who transports them advanced armor suits. Morty then goes on a seemingly uncharacteristic killing spree before Rick knocks him out, and he and Arthricia—who desired to stop the Festival—storm the castle of the corrupt nobility who introduced it, slaughtering them. The planet\\'s remaining inhabitants decide to create a new society; however, rioting breaks out over disputes, and one suggests keeping the Festival after all. Morty feels guilt over his rampage, but Rick (falsely) blames it on the effects of a candy bar he ate, and asserts that his character remains unchanged.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Beth discovers that Jerry wasted $700 calling Taddy Mason, who charges money just to talk on the phone, telling him to get a job.\\n\\nSeason 2, Episode 10: \"The Wedding Squanchers\"\\tWes Archer\\tTom Kauffman\\tOctober 4, 2015\\tRAM-209\\t1.84[20]\\nRick and his family attend the wedding of Birdperson and Tammy, whose guest list includes seventeen of the Federation\\'s most wanted — including Rick and Birdperson. At the wedding reception, Tammy reveals herself to be a Federation agent and kills Birdperson. Numerous agents invade the building, starting a battle against the guests. Rick gets his family out of the wedding safely, but they are unable to return home as the Federation would be looking for them there, so Rick takes them to a terraformed asteroid. Rick overhears Jerry proposing to turn Rick in and return to Earth, so Rick allows himself to be arrested. His family returns to Earth, which has joined the Federation and is crowded by alien tourists. Jerry is assigned a job by the Federation.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Mr. Poopybutthole asks the audience what they think will happen in season 3, and harasses a pizza delivery man with the same question. He also states that season 3 will come in a year and a half.\\n\\n\\n    Season 3, Episode 1: \"The Rickshank Rickdemption\"\\tJuan Meza-León\\tMike McMahan\\tApril 1, 2017\\tRAM-301\\t0.68[12][b]\\nRick is interrogated via a mind-computer link, inside a galactic federal prison. Summer and Morty attempt to rescue him but they are captured by SEAL Team Ricks, who take them to the Citadel of Ricks and decide to assassinate Rick. Back at the prison, Rick repeatedly switches bodies with both the federal agents and his aspiring assassins to reach the teleporter room of the Citadel of Ricks. He then teleports the entire Citadel into the federal prison, prompting a massive battle. Amid the confusion, Rick rescues Morty and Summer, and uses the Galactic Federation\\'s mainframe to make its currency worthless. This causes the Federation to collapse and leave Earth. Rick, Morty, and Summer return home, where Jerry gives Beth an ultimatum to choose between him and Rick. Beth chooses Rick and the couple decide to get a divorce. Rick reveals to Morty that his ulterior motive was to become his de facto male influence and get revenge at Jerry for threatening to turn him in to the authorities. This escalates into a monologue, centered around Rick\\'s desire to find more McDonald\\'s Szechuan sauce, a discontinued promotional product for the film Mulan.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Tammy observes Birdperson\\'s resurrection as a cyborg dubbed \"Phoenixperson\".\\n\\nSeason 3, Episode 2: \"Rickmancing the Stone\"\\tDominic Polcino\\tJane Becker\\tJuly 30, 2017\\tRAM-302\\t2.86[14]\\nRick takes Morty and Summer to a post-apocalyptic version of Earth, where they are chased by a group of scavengers, known as Death Stalkers. Rick notices that the group is carrying a valuable rock of Isotope 322, so he and the kids join them in hope of stealing it. Summer falls in love with the Death Stalkers\\' leader, while Morty is given the strength of a giant arm, which takes him in search of its previous owner\\'s killer. Rick leaves and replaces the kids with androids to fool Beth. When he returns, he helps the Death Stalkers use the Isotope to power a more advanced civilization. Summer does not like how the change softens the Death Stalkers, and she decides to follow Rick and Morty back home. Before leaving, Rick steals the isotope. The experience helps the kids overcome their parents\\' divorce. Summer reconciles with Jerry, and Morty realizes he must live his own life.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: As Jerry receives his unemployment check, a wolf bullies him into handing it over. The wolf eats the check and regurgitates it.\\n\\nSeason 3, Episode 3: \"Pickle Rick\"\\tAnthony Chun\\tJessica Gao\\tAugust 6, 2017\\tRAM-303\\t2.31[15]\\nRick turns himself into a pickle to get out of attending a school-sanctioned family therapy, but Beth takes Rick\\'s serum which would revert the transformation. Left alone, Rick eventually rolls into an open sewer drain, where he manages to manipulate the nervous systems of dead roaches and rats to build himself a mobile exoskeleton, with added weapons such as razors and drills. He unwittingly escapes into a foreign government agency. The guards try to kill Rick, under orders from the agency director, but Rick kills them all. In the process, Rick battles and ultimately befriends a prisoner named Jaguar. Near death and in need of the serum, Rick is forced to attend the therapy session, arriving towards the end. Dr. Wong gives her diagnosis, observing that Rick crafts relationships that punish emotions and vulnerability. On their way home, Rick apologizes to Beth for deceiving her and uses the serum to turn human again. Morty and Summer wish to continue seeing Dr. Wong, but Rick and Beth ignore them.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Jaguar saves Rick and Morty from being killed in an elaborate piano death machine by a villain named \"Concerto\".\\n\\nSeason 3, Episode 4: \"Vindicators 3: The Return of Worldender\"\\tBryan Newton\\tSarah Carbiener & Erica Rosbe\\tAugust 13, 2017\\tRAM-304\\t2.66[16]\\nAt Morty\\'s insistence, Rick agrees to meet again with the Vindicators, a group of intergalactic superheroes, to fight their archnemesis, Worldender. Rick cannot hide his disdain for the superheroes, while Morty is thrilled. The next morning, the Vindicators enter Worldender\\'s base. They find that, while Rick was blackout drunk the previous night, he killed Worldender and set up a variety of puzzles that the Vindicators must solve to survive. They start arguing and kill one another, while Morty solves all the puzzles. After all puzzles are solved, the only ones left alive are Rick, Morty, and Supernova, who is a member of the Vindicators. Supernova tries to kill Rick and Morty. Before she can do so, the three of them are transported to a party that Rick also set up while blackout drunk, and she escapes.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Gearhead tries to use a Vindicators vest to impress some teen girls, but when an alien terrorist attack strikes, he flees then trips and falls, breaking into pieces.\\n\\nSeason 3, Episode 5: \"The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy\"\\tJuan Meza-León\\tRyan Ridley\\tAugust 20, 2017\\tRAM-305\\t2.29[17]\\nAt Morty\\'s request, Rick takes Jerry on an adventure to bolster Jerry\\'s self-esteem. They visit an alien resort where Jerry encounters Risotto Groupon, an alien who blames Rick for his kingdom being usurped. Risotto enlists Jerry in a plot to kill Rick, but the attempt fails and Rick deduces Jerry\\'s involvement, sparking a monologue of him accusing Jerry of deliberately acting helpless to guilt others into helping him. After Rick kills Risotto, he softens his attitude towards Jerry, but refuses to let him return to the family. Meanwhile, Summer\\'s boyfriend Ethan leaves her for a larger-breasted girlfriend, and Summer attempts to enlarge her own breasts using one of Rick\\'s devices. Her aim is off, and her and Beth\\'s attempts to fix things only cause her to be turned inside out and grow into a giant. Beth is tricked into releasing three tiny technical support workers that were trapped inside the machine. Summer disappears to the campsite she and Ethan were supposed to go, still inside out. Beth turns herself inside out and talks to Summer, reconciling. Once Morty figures out how the machine works, he restores Summer\\'s size and spitefully uses it to deform Ethan.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: The three tiny workers are enjoying their retirement. As a deformed Ethan walks by, one of them is snatched by an eagle.\\n\\nSeason 3, Episode 6: \"Rest and Ricklaxation\"\\tAnthony Chun\\tTom Kauffman\\tAugust 27, 2017\\tRAM-306\\t2.47[18]\\nAfter a traumatic six-day adventure, Rick and Morty decide to spend some time at an alien spa, where they use a machine that extracts a person\\'s negative personality traits. However, unbeknownst to them, those traits are transposed into toxic physical counterparts, characterized by Rick\\'s arrogance and Morty\\'s self-loathing. The Clean Rick becomes more considerate, and Clean Morty\\'s confidence soars, which allows him to start dating girls. Swearing revenge on Clean Rick, Toxic Rick takes Toxic Morty, breaks out of the machine, and uses a moonlight tower to remake the whole Earth into a toxic version of itself. Clean Rick reverts the situation by poisoning Toxic Morty, correctly deducing that the true Rick considered his compassion for Morty a weakness, meaning Toxic Rick has inherited that trait. Toxic Rick angrily merges with Clean Rick to save Toxic Morty, bringing back the true Rick. Clean Morty avoids merging back with his toxic counterpart and goes on to live a life as a stockbroker in New York City. Rick tracks him down with Jessica\\'s help and restores order by re-injecting Toxic Morty back into Clean Morty.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: A tour of the same moonlight tower releases Stacy, one of the girls Morty dated in the episode, who had been inadvertently trapped inside the toxin machine.\\n\\nSeason 3, Episode 7: \"The Ricklantis Mixup\"[c]\\tDominic Polcino\\tDan Guterman & Ryan Ridley\\tSeptember 10, 2017\\tRAM-307\\t2.38[20]\\nAs Rick and Morty adventure to Atlantis, the episode shifts focus towards the Citadel, a secret society populated by numerous versions of Ricks and Mortys. There, a group of Mortys journey to a portal to have their wishes granted; a novice police officer Rick starts working with a veteran police Morty to take down drug dealers; a worker Rick revolts at a wafer factory, where the key ingredient is extracted from a Rick hooked up to a machine to re-experience his best memories; and an election is held for the new president of the Citadel.

However, upon returning home, they realize they left Summer behind and return on a rescue mission, only to find that Summer does not have a Glorzo attached to her and is worshiped as a goddess. Summer explains that after Rick and Morty fell under the control of the Glorzo, she was spared due to a toothpick in her mouth, which prevented the Glorzo from being able to latch on to her face and caused them to consider her a goddess.

Rick grudgingly agrees creating a special remote, but Morty takes it before he can explain how it works. Morty then commits numerous crimes and pranks and resets himself to avoid consequences.

When they end up stranded in the wilderness, Morty considers using the remote but calls for rescue instead, wanting to preserve the relationship he has. However, after Morty is rescued, Jerry accidentally presses the remote, resetting Morty back to before the relationship started. Morty fails his attempt to restart the relationship when his save point is accidentally overwritten, and he returns to Rick, saying he has learned his lesson that one shouldn\\'t live a consequence free life. Rick then reveals that the remote does not reset the timeline, but instead teleports Morty to an alternate dimension, and also kills the Morty native to that dimension so Morty can take his place. Horrified, Morty begs Rick to undo everything, so Rick merges all of the alternate dimensions. While this prevents the deaths of the alternate Mortys, everybody remembers the crimes Morty committed, and the only way he can escape is to jump into a vat of fake acid to fake his death. Satisfied his point was proven, Rick reveals they were in an alternate dimension this entire time, as he didn\\'t want to risk Morty ruining their home dimension.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: A policeman who believes he\\'s impervious to acid appears on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (Johnny Carson still being alive in the alternate dimension) and lowers himself into a vat of real acid, which results in his death.\\n\\nSeason 4, Episode 9: \"Childrick of Mort\"\\tKyounghee Lim\\tJames Siciliano\\tMay 24, 2020\\tRAM-409\\t1.22[16]\\nAs Jerry takes the family out on a camping trip, Rick receives a call from Gaia, a sentient planet, that she is pregnant with his children.

CEO Jennith Padrow-Chunt brings in a squad of armed fortune-boosted guards, alongside Jerry\\'s mother to ensure he follows through with his fate, until Rick feeds Jerry another fortune cookie that cancels it out at the last minute.

Rick dons Pissmaster\\'s suit and performs many heroic deeds, redeeming the villain\\'s public image.

Without the Knights\\' influence, a peace summit among the leaders of the planets fails and a war breaks out. Morty finds the Knights of the Sun using heroin and inspires them to resume their duties by promising he will cut off his penis, Rick having built him a fake.
